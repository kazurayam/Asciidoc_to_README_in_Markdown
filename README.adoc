= Include directive is not supported in Github-flavored Asciidoc --- a workaround

== Problem to solve

In a GitHub repository, you can make a file named `README.adoc` in https://asciidoc-py.github.io/index.html[Asciidoc] format. GitHub is able to convert Asciidoc text to HTML runtime so that it renders in browsers. A sample is here:

- https://github.com/kazurayam/IncludeIsNotSupportedInGithubFlavoredAsciidoc-a_workaround/blob/master/article.adoc[article.adoc]

This looks very nice! You can enjoy the Asciidoc capabilities to author your documents and publish them in GitHub.
However, there is a caveat in GitHub Flavored Asciidoc. *GitHub Flavored Asciidoc does not support the `include::path/to/file[]` directive.* See the subsection titled "Include directive" at the tail of https://github.com/kazurayam/IncludeIsNotSupportedInGithubFlavoredAsciidoc-a_workaround/blob/master/article.adoc[article.adoc].

I intended to embed the source code of my Java program into the article for reference. I expected to see something as follows.

Here we include the source code of the file `src/main/java/my/Hello.java`.

== Include directive

[source,java]
----
include::src/main/java/my/Hello.java[]

You need to install `pandoc` and `asciidoctor`.
