In a GitHub repository, you can make a file `README.adoc` in Asciidoc format.
GitHub happily renders the file in browser.
You can enjoy Asciidoc capabilities to author documents.



However, there is a defect.

GitHub-flavored-Asciidoc does not support `include::file/path/to/include[]` directive.

You need to install `pandoc` and `asciidoctor`.
