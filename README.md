# Include directive is not supported in Github-flavored Asciidoc ---- a workaround proposed

## Problem to solve

In a GitHub repository, you can make a file named `README.adoc` in [Asciidoc](https://asciidoc-py.github.io/index.html) format. GitHub is able to convert Asciidoc text to HTML runtime so that it renders in browsers. You can enjoy the Asciidoc capabilities to author your documents and publish them in GitHub. A sample is here:

-   [article.adoc](https://github.com/kazurayam/IncludeIsNotSupportedInGithubFlavoredAsciidoc-a_workaround/blob/master/article.adoc)

However, there is a caveat in GitHub Flavored Asciidoc. **GitHub Flavored Asciidoc (GFA) does not support the `include::path/to/file[]` directive.** See the subsection titled "Include directive" at the tail of [article.adoc](https://github.com/kazurayam/IncludeIsNotSupportedInGithubFlavoredAsciidoc-a_workaround/blob/master/article.adoc).

This is not what I wanted to see! I want the code embeded into the document, as follows.

I need the Include directive in my README documents in Asciidoc on GitHub. Seriously! The include directive is the very reason why I want to use Asciidoc, instead of Markdown.

Why GitHub does not support Include directive in Asciidoc? --- There is a discussion about it, which was opened 4 years ago and still remain open.

-   [Asciidoctor: support include directives for other asciidoc files #1095](https://github.com/github/markup/issues/1095)

As far as I learned from this discussion, it seems unlikely that GitHub adds the Include directive support in future. Is there any workaround?

## Solution

In [the discussion](https://github.com/github/markup/issues/1095), @chevdoor posted a workaround at 9th June 2021. Here I will quote his post entirely.

    This is by far my favorite workaround although it requires a little setup and tooling.
    Install pandoc and asciidoctor, you can then create a new (executable) .gti/hooks/pre-commit file with the following content:


    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    # convert all the files in the root
    find . -iname "*.adoc" -type f -maxdepth 1 -not -name "_*.adoc" | while read fname; do
      target=${fname//adoc/md}
      xml=${fname//adoc/xml}
      echo "converting $fname into $target"

      asciidoctor -b docbook -a leveloffset=+1 -o - "$fname" | pandoc  --markdown-headings=atx --wrap=preserve -t markdown_strict -f docbook - > "$target"
      echo deleting $xml
      rm -f "$xml"
    done

    # if we find a readme*.md, we rename to README.md
    find . -iname "readme*.md" -not -name "README.md" -type f -maxdepth 1 | while read fname; do
      echo Renaming $fname to README.md
      mv $fname README.md
    done


    The script will look for all the adoc files in the root of your project (except those starting with _) and convert them. Since github picks the asciidoc by default when you have both a README.adoc and a README.md ðŸ¤¦ , I have to further get my README.adoc out of the way renaming to README_src.adoc) and add extra renaming to the script.

    To cheer us up, this option comes with a small benefit: your asciidoc is now linted before you ever commit, so you will spot wrong includes paths before your commit makes it in.

This worked for me! So I decided to introduce it into my projects.

## Description

I will describe here what I have done to author [README of this repository](https://github.com/kazurayam/IncludeIsNotSupportedInGithubFlavoredAsciidoc-a_workaround/blob/master/README.md).

### Environment

-   machine: Mac Book Air

-   OS: macOS Monterey v12.0.1

### External dependencies

#### pandoc

I needed [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), a universal document converter. I installed pandoc using \[Homebrew\](<https://brew.sh/>).

    $ brew install pandoc

#### asciidoctor

I need [asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/), A fast text processor & publishing toolchain for converting AsciiDoc to HTML5, DocBook & more. I installed asciidoctor using Homebrew.

    $ brew install asciidoctor

### shell script

I added a shell script named [&lt;projectDir>/readmeconv.sh](readmeconv.sh) in the root directory. It contains the code which @chevdoor proposed.

I changed the mode of this file *executable*.

    $ chmod +x ./readmeconv.sh

### Git hook

I edited the `<projectDir>/.git/hooks/pre-commit` so that it executes the `readmeconv.sh` script on `git commit`.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>#!/usr/bin/env bash</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>git secrets --pre_commit_hookâ€‰â€”â€‰"$@"</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><p># convert README.adoc to README.md</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>./readmeconv.sh</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### GitHub repository setting

In case your GitHub project contains both of `README.md` and `README.adoc`, when you query the projectâ€™s top URL, GitHub will respond README.adoc instead of README.md as default. I donâ€™t like this. I want my project to respond with `README.md` generated by the `readmeconv.sh` script.

## The Result

In the `<projectDir>/README.adoc`, I wrote as follows:

    [source,shell]
    \----
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    git secrets --pre_commit_hook -- "$@"

    # convert README.adoc to README.md
    ./readmeconv.sh
    \----

Please note I used `include` directive here. And you can see the result at
